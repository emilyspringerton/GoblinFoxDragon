## Title Card (silent)
**TYLER // BUILD 0001 // DOCUMENTARY UNIT A**
**LOCATION:** Detroit, MI
**STATUS:** Incident Active

## [0:00–0:10] — Handheld chaos, too real
A shaky camera pushes through a dim hallway. A cheap lav mic crackles.

**PRODUCER (O.S.)**
Keep rolling. Keep rolling. Don’t—don’t get close—

The camera swings past a living room: furniture half-shifted like someone moved it in a hurry. A table is on its side. Nobody reacts like it’s strange.

A soft neon glow bleeds from the kitchen—subtle, impossible.

**LOWER THIRD (DOC UI):**
TUESDAY // “JUST A NORMAL NIGHT”

## [0:10–0:25] — Interview: the denial
Cut to a calm sit-down interview. Warm lamp light. A person stares at camera with the exhausted serenity of someone who’s stopped trying to explain.

**SUBJECT #1**
He showed up asking for a glass of water like he lived here.
Then he asked what year it was.
Like—politely. Like it was my fault.

**PRODUCER (O.S.)**
And you let him in?

**SUBJECT #1**
…Yeah.
Because he smiled.

**ON SCREEN (tiny, like a log):**
PRESSURE ↑

## [0:25–0:40] — The first receipt
Hard cut: security cam footage. Grainy. Timestamp reads 1901.

A man turns toward the camera in a crowded street—classic suit, calm eyes. He tips his hat directly at the lens like he knows you.

**SUBJECT #1 (V.O.)**
That’s him.

**PRODUCER (V.O.)**
That’s impossible.

**SUBJECT #1 (V.O.)**
Yeah.

**ON SCREEN:**
MIGRATION EVENT DETECTED

## [0:40–0:55] — Tyler enters like a rumor
Back to handheld. The camera peeks into the kitchen.

TYLER stands by the sink, washing his hands. He looks ordinary—except he moves like he’s never been surprised once in his life.

He glances at the camera without turning fully.

**TYLER**
You’re early.

**CAMERA OP**
Who are you?

Tyler dries his hands carefully. Too carefully.

**TYLER**
Depends who’s asking.

He smiles—gentle, practiced.

**TYLER (CONT.)**
Is this the cut where you make me the villain?

**ON SCREEN (quiet):**
AH SHOCK: LISTINGS SPIKE

## [0:55–1:10] — The factions reveal themselves (without names)
A door opens behind Tyler. Someone steps in—clean suit, calm posture. Their presence changes the room temperature.

**SUIT (to Tyler)**
We can end this quietly.

Tyler doesn’t turn.

**TYLER**
You’ve never ended anything.
You only rename it.

**ON SCREEN:**
CONFLICT ↑

## [1:10–1:25] — The impossible act (tiny but undeniable)
Tyler reaches into his pocket. Pulls out a coin.

He flips it. The coin hangs for a beat—too long—then lands.

The camera zooms in: the coin’s face shows a date that changes mid-focus.

**CAMERA OP (whisper)**
What the—

**TYLER**
Shh.

He looks straight into lens for the first time.

**TYLER**
If you keep filming, you become part of it.

A beat.

**TYLER (CONT.)**
But you’re going to keep filming.

## [1:25–1:30] — Title hit
Smash cut to black.

**TITLE:**
TYLER
A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT A MAN WHO WON’T STAY IN HIS OWN YEAR

**END LOG (one line):**
BIRD CORRECTION PENDING

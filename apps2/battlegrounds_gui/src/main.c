/* DragonsNShit Battlegrounds GUI — forked from REDGARDEN's apps/arena at commit
 * 61baafb4455c1c66dc7dac35db06dd315cf5da02 (2026-08-02), per REDGARDEN_GUI_NORTHSTAR.md and
 * founder direction: "fork redgarden into GFD... this is the mmo, this is dragonsnshit" /
 * "REDGARDEN isnt literally the GUI its supposed to be a starting place for the GUI like a
 * clean fork." This is a real, standalone copy living in GoblinFoxDragon's own repo (like
 * apps/lobby's own SHANKPIT fork) -- not a live checkout of the REDGARDEN repo at build time.
 * It can diverge from REDGARDEN going forward; REDGARDEN's own copy is unaffected by edits here
 * and vice versa. Self-contained: packages/ here is this fork's own copy, not a symlink or
 * reference into GFD's existing top-level packages/ or packages2/ (which have unrelated,
 * real content of their own -- packages2/common/protocol.h in particular is a completely
 * different wire protocol, apps2/server-go's, not this one).
 *
 * Original REDGARDEN header, preserved below:
 *
 * RED GARDEN — single-hero click-to-move arena demo.
 *
 * New, additive client: does not touch apps/lobby or the existing card-RTS.
 * Modern-GL (shader) rendering on purpose -- this sidesteps the GL/glu.h
 * dependency that blocks apps/lobby on this box (no libglu1-mesa-dev
 * installed): a shader pipeline only needs GL/gl.h + SDL_GL_GetProcAddress
 * function loading, no GLU, no GLEW/GLAD.

 * ever needed a nonzero one -- Town's own avatar, to sit on the real Dragonfly zone's own
 * elevated terrain (town_ground_y) instead of assuming y=0 -- used to fake it by pre-multiplying
 * the camera's own vp matrix with a translation (`jump_t * vp`) and passing that AS `vp`. That's
 * mathematically wrong: a translation applied AFTER `vp` (which already includes the perspective
 * projection) operates in clip space, not world space, and does NOT correspond to a uniform
 * world-space shift once the perspective divide happens -- confirmed empirically (a direct,
 * controlled comparison: the exact same draw call with a real, unmodified `vp` rendered
 * correctly; with the pre-multiplied one, invisible, regardless of size). The correct fix:
 * thread the Y offset through the MODEL side (added to every box's own `dy`), where a world-space
 * shift genuinely belongs, and always pass the real, untouched `vp` through unchanged. */

/* ---------------- combat log pane (2026-08-02) ----------------
 * Founder: "add a second chat pane to GFD that shows the combat log." A second, read-only pane
 * alongside the MUD chat pane above -- distinct data source (this hero's fight, not IDUNA chat)
 * and distinct screen position (bottom-right, mirroring chat's bottom-left) so the two never
 * overlap and are never confused for each other.
 *
 * No wire packet carries discrete damage/kill events (protocol.h's ArenaHero snapshot only ever
 * broadcasts point-in-time hp/alive, see its own struct comment) -- so this is derived entirely
 * client-side by diffing arena_state.heroes[] frame-to-frame. Works identically for local
 * single-player (arena_update() drives arena_state directly), net_mode (net_poll_snapshots()
 * writes the server's authoritative state into the same arena_state), and observing/replay
 * (arena_replay_apply_at() does the same) -- combat_log_scan() is called once per frame right
 * after whichever of those three just ran, so it always reads this frame's freshest state
 * regardless of where it came from.
 *
 * Attacker attribution uses attack_target (S170-162, synced over the wire for every hero, see
 * PACKET_ARENA_SNAPSHOT_HEROES's own decode): if some other living hero has attack_target ==
 * the victim's slot, credit them by name; otherwise the damage is unattributed (a DoT, a creep,
 * a skillshot from a hero not currently attack-locked on them, etc.) and just shows the amount.
 * Deliberately does not log healing -- real heals happen often (fountain, Ghost's kit) and would
 * bury the signal a combat log is actually for; scope here is damage taken + deaths, the same
 * MVP a first "combat log" pane needs. */

 * heightmap for each of the three column-derived biomes (chunk 0,0) over HTTP, builds one mesh
 * per biome, and renders all three side by side floating beside Town so both the mesh-generation
 * code (Milestone 2) and the biome-coloring (Milestone 3, biome_color below) can be seen and
 * validated against real backend data -- not a real walkable zone, not wired into
 * movement/collision. Lazy-loaded on first press so Town's own startup never depends on worldapi
 * being reachable. */

 * style client) -- TelecrystalDef/telecast_state/telecrystal_tick/draw_world_telecrystals/

 * crystal's own real radius (server/telecrystal's real `Radius: 12` for both
 * TELECRYSTAL_ID_HANDINGTON_TO_MEADOW and TELECRYSTAL_ID_MEADOW_RETURN_HANDINGTON, not a guess),
 * pulsing when out of range and turning solid white when in range; pressing G while in range
 * starts a cast (not an instant teleport); the cast bar fills over cast_total_ms with a visible
 * "commit" tick mark at cast_commit_ms, where the real travel/return call actually fires (same
 * "commit before the bar visually finishes" feel the reference has); leaving the ring before
 * commit cancels the cast. Replaces the previous right-click-on-a-tiny-box trigger entirely --
 * this IS the real crystal interaction now, not an alternate path.
 *
 * Scoped down from the reference's own generic N-crystal TELECRYSTAL_DEFS table: this client has
 * exactly one real interactive gate (Dragon Gate), whose identity (position/radius/prompt/target)
 * flips between the two real registry entries depending on g_dfzone_active -- same "one gate,
 * both directions" design the click-based version already established, just carried into the
 * cast system instead of duplicating a 2-entry table for it. */

 * Founder: "make the auction house real - menu based system navigatable with arrow keys and

 * apps2/mud already has a full, working Auction House (server/market.AuctionHouse, cmdAH's own
 * real `ah browse|sell|buy|history|status|cancel` telnet subcommands) -- this is a GUI front end
 * for it, routed through the exact same real headless-session dispatch Town's chat commands
 * already use (town_send_command), not a second, fake economy.
 *
 * Scope, honestly: `ah browse <category>` only ever returns item-level aggregates (name, lowest
 * price, listing count) -- no individual listing IDs, so there is genuinely no real command a
 * telnet player could use to buy a SPECIFIC listing from someone else's browse either; this is a
 * real, pre-existing gap in cmdAH itself, not something invented or skipped here. What IS real
 * and actionable: browsing categories, browsing items within a category, and viewing + cancelling
 * your OWN listings (`ah status` returns real listing IDs, `ah cancel <id>` is a real action). */

# EINHORN_MEDIA — Investor FAQ (Risk → Mitigation → Metrics)

*(and beneath it: Pilot Cold Open, ~90 seconds)*

---

# 1) Investor FAQ — **EINHORN_MEDIA // METAVERSE WORKS**

### What we’re building

A media subsidiary that produces **metaverse-native “compiled” drama**: canonical episodes + dynamic, auditable surfaces (billboards/props/overlays) that can be swapped like static-site generation—without touching plot integrity.
The flagship IP is **TYLER (HARRY_HOUDINI)**: historical-fiction time-travel mocumentary that can run forever, cleanly.

---

## A) Core Strategic Risks

### **Risk 1 — “Dynamic ads will feel intrusive or scammy.”**

**Mitigation**

* Ads are **world objects** only (billboards, prop labels, doc UI lower-third), never mid-scene cutaways.
* **Canon firewall:** ad swaps cannot change dialogue, motivations, or outcomes.
* Viewer-facing **ChangeLog/Credits**: “what changed” is visible and auditable.

**Metrics**

* Ad-related churn (cancel/stop after ad-heavy episodes)
* “Intrusiveness” sentiment score (post-episode quick poll + social)
* Ad recall vs. annoyance delta
* Complaint rate per 10k views

---

### **Risk 2 — “Metaverse distribution is fragmented; platforms shift.”**

**Mitigation**

* Produce via a **platform-agnostic build pipeline**: canonical assets → compiled packages for SteamVR/Quest/PC/flat stream.
* Always ship a standard “flat” cut that is identical in story content.
* Maintain a minimal “core renderer” standard for in-world overlays.

**Metrics**

* Platform mix (view minutes by platform)
* Cost per platform port (time + $)
* Crash-free sessions / technical NPS per platform
* % of viewership on “flat” vs “metaverse” (healthy if either wins)

---

### **Risk 3 — “Personalization drifts into creepy surveillance.”**

**Mitigation**

* We personalize **format**, not truth: language, accessibility, ad surface selection by broad context—not behavioral micro-targeting.
* Strict category bans (health/politics manipulation, predatory finance, etc.).
* Privacy posture: minimal data retention; audit logs; opt-out defaults in sensitive regions.

**Metrics**

* Opt-out rate
* Data requests / regulatory flags
* Trust score (periodic viewer survey)
* Sponsor category compliance rate

---

### **Risk 4 — “Forever drama burns out writers / becomes incoherent.”**

**Mitigation**

* The writers’ room uses **systems constraints**: factions, rules, and “incident templates” that generate conflict without lore rot.
* Each episode must end with a **receipt** (artifact/log/clip) that anchors canon.
* Seasonal “canon resets” that reframe without retconning.

**Metrics**

* Completion rate per episode
* Season-to-season retention
* Lore confusion index (support tickets + community Qs)
* Rewatch rate (high = coherent)

---

### **Risk 5 — “Brand safety: the show’s chaos could repel premium sponsors.”**

**Mitigation**

* Ad inventory is **tiered surfaces**:
  * Tier 1: neutral background props
  * Tier 2: diegetic billboards
  * Tier 3: doc UI sponsor line (rare)
* Brand-safety filters by episode rating, scene tags, region.
* Sponsors buy **surfaces**, not narrative control.

**Metrics**

* Fill rate by tier
* CPM by tier
* Sponsor renewal rate
* Brand-safety incident count (target ~0)

---

## B) Why this de-risks scale launches (the console analogy)

**Phase 1 (Now):** compile pipeline + audit + flat distribution proves the “canon firewall.”
**Phase 2:** metaverse events and watch parties validate conversion without rewriting episodes.
**Phase 3:** platform partnerships (console/metaverse) become *distribution*, not existential tech risk—because the show is already shippable everywhere.

**Metrics that matter for Phase Gates**

* Day-7 retention (series)
* Episode completion rate
* Watch-party participation rate
* Ad tier fill + renewal
* Technical stability: crash-free minutes + support volume
* Trust: opt-out + sentiment + complaint rate

# 2) PILOT COLD OPEN — **TYLER (HARRY_HOUDINI)** (≈90 seconds)

**TITLE CARD (silent):**
`TYLER // BUILD 0001 // DOCUMENTARY UNIT A`
`LOCATION: DETROIT, MI`
`STATUS: INCIDENT ACTIVE`

---

### [0:00–0:10] — Handheld chaos, too real

A shaky camera pushes through a dim hallway. A cheap lav mic crackles.

**PRODUCER (O.S.)**
Keep rolling. Keep rolling. Don’t—don’t get close—

The camera swings past a living room: furniture half-shifted like someone moved it in a hurry. A table is **on its side**. Nobody reacts like it’s strange.

A soft neon glow bleeds from the kitchen—subtle, impossible.

**LOWER THIRD (DOC UI):**
`TUESDAY // “JUST A NORMAL NIGHT”`

---

### [0:10–0:25] — Interview: the denial

Cut to a calm sit-down interview. Warm lamp light. A person stares at camera with the exhausted serenity of someone who’s stopped trying to explain.

**SUBJECT #1**
He showed up asking for a glass of water like he lived here.
Then he asked what year it was.
Like—politely. Like it was my fault.

**PRODUCER (O.S.)**
And you let him in?

**SUBJECT #1**
…Yeah.
Because he smiled.

**ON SCREEN (tiny, like a log):**
`PRESSURE ↑`

---

### [0:25–0:40] — The first receipt

Hard cut: security cam footage. Grainy. Timestamp reads **1901**.

A man turns toward the camera in a crowded street—classic suit, calm eyes. He tips his hat directly at the lens like he knows you.

**SUBJECT #1 (V.O.)**
That’s him.

**PRODUCER (V.O.)**
That’s impossible.

**SUBJECT #1 (V.O.)**
Yeah.

**ON SCREEN:**
`MIGRATION EVENT DETECTED`

---

### [0:40–0:55] — Tyler enters like a rumor

Back to handheld. The camera peeks into the kitchen.

**TYLER** stands by the sink, washing his hands. He looks ordinary—except he moves like he’s never been surprised once in his life.

He glances at the camera without turning fully.

**TYLER**
You’re early.

**CAMERA OP**
Who are you?

Tyler dries his hands carefully. Too carefully.

**TYLER**
Depends who’s asking.

He smiles—gentle, practiced.

**TYLER (CONT.)**
Is this the cut where you make me the villain?

**ON SCREEN (quiet):**
`AH SHOCK: LISTINGS SPIKE`

---

### [0:55–1:10] — The factions reveal themselves (without names)

A door opens behind Tyler. Someone steps in—clean suit, calm posture. Their presence changes the room temperature.

**SUIT (to Tyler)**
We can end this quietly.

Tyler doesn’t turn.

**TYLER**
You’ve never ended anything.
You only rename it.

**ON SCREEN:**
`CONFLICT ↑`

---

### [1:10–1:25] — The impossible act (tiny but undeniable)

Tyler reaches into his pocket. Pulls out a coin.

He flips it. The coin hangs for a beat—too long—then lands.

The camera zooms in: the coin’s face shows a date that **changes** mid-focus.

**CAMERA OP (whisper)**
What the—

**TYLER**
Shh.

He looks straight into lens for the first time.

**TYLER**
If you keep filming, you become part of it.

A beat.

**TYLER (CONT.)**
But you’re going to keep filming.

---

### [1:25–1:30] — Title hit

Smash cut to black.

**TITLE:**
**TYLER**
**A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT A MAN WHO WON’T STAY IN HIS OWN YEAR**

**END LOG (one line):**
`BIRD CORRECTION PENDING`

---

If you want, I’ll also write the **Pilot Episode 1 one-page outline** (A-story romance engine + B-story anomaly + end “receipt”) that keeps the K-drama/soap momentum while preserving the Honor-Code “canon firewall.”

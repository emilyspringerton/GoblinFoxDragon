# EPISODE 2 (CONT.) — “THE SCHOOL THAT ISN’T THERE”

**Alternate Timeline:** CURSE INDEX = UNKNOWN
**Documentary Unit:** still rolling. Nobody’s sure why.

---

## ACT I — “THE VAN THAT WON’T LEAVE”

The production van is parked in a no-parking zone that should have been ticketed three times by now.

It hasn’t been.

Not because the city is kind.

Because the city is busy doing something else—quietly re-lacing itself around Tyler like it’s tightening a shoe.

Inside the van, the air is warm with batteries and nervous breathing.

MARA (Director) leans toward the monitor wall—four feeds stacked:

CAM A: Tyler, handheld, following his right shoulder

CAM B: wide street, locked-off, too stable

CAM C: boom mic + reflections in shop windows (accidentally prophetic)

CAM D: body-cam on Tyler, low-angle, always catching his hands

Mara hasn’t blinked in a while.

MARA
(to nobody, to everybody)
Okay. New rule. Nobody says “ghost.” Nobody says “time.” Nobody says “simulation.”
We’re documenting a civic… phenomenon.

JULES (Sound)
Phenomenon is what you call mold in a rental.

LEN (Producer)
We call it a story. Stories get notes.
Phenomena get audits.

A cigarette burns down in an ashtray that isn’t allowed in the van.

The van, like the city, has stopped caring about rules that don’t serve the moment.

On the monitor, Tyler is outside, standing on a sidewalk that feels normal until you look at the signage.

A street sign reads:
SCHOOL ZONE
and below it:
SCHOOL: NONE

It is not vandalism. The paint is municipal. The bolts are tight.

Tyler looks up at it the way you look at a menu that’s been rewritten in a language you almost know.

He speaks without turning, like he can feel the cameras as warmth on the back of his neck.

TYLER
So… I’m just supposed to walk toward the thing that says it’s not there?

A car passes behind him.

The car’s radio is tuned to static.

In the static, there’s a voice—so faint you can’t tell if it’s the radio or the city itself.

“…custody… custody… custody…”

Jules leans forward, listening like a priest who has heard his own name in the confessional.

JULES
Did you hear that?

MARA
Don’t narrate it. Capture it.

Len exhales a laugh with no humor.

LEN
If it’s real, we capture it. If it’s not real, we capture the believing.
Either way, we capture.

Tyler starts walking.

And the sidewalk moves with him.

Not physically. Not in a way you can point to.

But it’s as if the city has decided, yes, okay—this is the direction now.

## ACT II — “THE BUILDING”

They reach an intersection where a school should be.

There are the normal signs of a school:

crosswalk paint refreshed too recently

a speed bump shaped like a warning

yellow bollards

a chain-link fence with new padlocks

But behind the fence is a vacant lot—dead winter grass and a single swing set with no swings.

The kind of place where the imagination tries to fill in the missing shapes.

Tyler stands at the fence.

The cameras adjust exposure like they’re bracing themselves.

Mara whispers into comms.

MARA
Stay on his hands. Always stay on his hands.

Tyler’s fingers tighten around the chain-link.

His knuckles whiten.

And the air… bulges.

That’s the only word for it.

Not a sound, not a flash.

A pressure shift like the world inhaling.

Then—

A building is there.

Not like it fades in.

Like it has always been there and the universe just stopped pretending otherwise.

A three-story brick school with blank windows and a banner that says:

WELCOME BACK
and underneath:
WE MISSED YOU

Tyler recoils, a step back, involuntary.

TYLER
No. No, no, no—

The banner flutters in a wind that doesn’t touch anything else.

Inside the van, Len goes pale.

LEN
Holy—
(catches himself)
Okay. That’s… okay.

Jules’ mic spikes, a faint chorus of children laughing, not from the building, not from the lot—

From the fence.

Mara speaks softly, professionally, like she’s directing a cooking show and the ingredients just started bleeding.

MARA
Tyler, narrate what you’re feeling. Keep it present tense.

Tyler swallows hard.

TYLER
It feels like… it feels like I’m being graded.

He looks at the front doors. Double doors. Glass. Frosted.

On the glass, etched neatly:

CUSTODY OFFICE — VISITORS CHECK IN

The documentary crew doesn’t want to go in.

And they want to go in so badly it’s almost shameful.

That’s the thing about storms: you don’t want to die, but you want to see the lightning up close.

Tyler reaches for the gate latch.

It clicks open.

The padlock falls free—unused, unnecessary, a prop for rules that no longer apply.

The crew follows.

Because the crew always follows.

## ACT III — “CHECK IN”

The school is silent.

Not abandoned-silent.

Held-breath silent.

Every step echoes like it’s being recorded by the building itself.

In the lobby, there’s a desk.

Behind the desk: a woman in a cardigan, hair in a tight bun, wearing a laminated badge.

Her badge reads:

HANA
CUSTODY

Tyler stops dead.

Not fear. Not surprise.

Recognition—like a name you weren’t supposed to remember.

On the monitors, Cam B glitches for half a second, and the wide shot shows something impossible:

For one frame, Tyler is alone in the lobby.

No crew.

No cameras.

Just him.

Then the crew is back in frame, like the universe reluctantly lets them exist again.

Mara’s voice cracks, just slightly.

MARA
Did… did we drop out?

Len doesn’t answer.

He’s staring at the “one frame” freeze like it’s a death certificate.

The woman behind the desk looks up.

Her eyes are calm, tired, and not surprised to see Tyler.

She doesn’t smile.

She doesn’t frown.

She just says, very gently:

HANA
You’re late.

Tyler’s mouth opens, closes.

TYLER
I— I don’t go here.

Hana’s gaze flicks to the cameras.

Not with fear.

With… assessment.

Like she’s deciding whether the cameras are witnesses or liabilities.

HANA
You brought observers.

Tyler glances back at the crew, helpless.

Mara steps forward, as if professionalism can protect her.

MARA
Hi. We’re… we’re documenting—

Hana raises one finger.

Not rude. Not angry.

A simple “stop.”

And the entire crew stops talking, mid-breath.

Jules’ boom dips involuntarily like gravity got heavier.

Len’s jaw tightens.

Tyler looks back, eyes wide.

He can still speak.

The crew can’t.

Hana speaks to Tyler only.

HANA
Custody doesn’t like an audience.
But the cursed timeline always brings one.

Tyler’s skin prickles at the phrase—cursed timeline—like it’s a word his body recognizes before his mind does.

TYLER
What is custody?

Hana taps a clipboard on the desk.

The paper is blank.

But Tyler can see writing on it anyway. His eyes track lines that aren’t there.

HANA
Custody is who holds the blame when reality breaks.
In this timeline, reality breaks cleanly.
No mess. No noise. Just… certainty.

She turns the clipboard toward him.

At the top of the blank page, in ink that is definitely there:

SUBJECT: Tyler
STATUS: Unclaimed
RISK: Magnet

Tyler’s voice is small.

TYLER
Unclaimed by who?

Hana’s eyes soften, just a fraction.

HANA
That’s the question you keep walking around instead of into.

She nods toward a hallway.

A sign on the wall reads:

PRINCIPAL
and below it:
—NOT HERE—

Tyler stares at it.

Then, because he can’t help himself, he asks:

TYLER
Why can I talk and they can’t?

Hana’s lips twitch like she almost laughs, but doesn’t.

HANA
Because you’re the one in custody.
They’re just… filming the paperwork.

## ACT IV — “THE DOCUMENTARY CREW’S COUNTERSHOT”

The crew is still frozen—mouths parted, bodies locked in the humiliating stillness of being paused by someone else’s rules.

The cameras, though—

The cameras keep rolling.

Cam A stays on Tyler.

Cam C’s reflection feed catches the crew in the lobby glass: a tableau of stopped humans, eyes moving, trapped in their own bodies.

Mara’s eyes dart left and right, furious at her own silence.

Len blinks hard, trying to force speech with willpower.

Jules’ hands tremble on the boom pole like a man holding a cross in a vampire house.

And then—because the universe has a sense of humor—

the slate clapper on the floor flips itself shut.

CLACK.

The sound echoes.

Hana tilts her head at it, mildly annoyed.

Tyler flinches like the building just coughed.

Hana looks at the crew again, and for the first time her expression carries something like pity.

HANA
They keep thinking the camera makes them safe.

She leans closer to Tyler, voice lowering.

HANA
It doesn’t.

She gestures.

And the crew can speak again, but only in whispers—as if their vocal cords have been downgraded.

Mara’s first whisper is pure anger.

MARA (whisper)
What the hell are you?

Hana looks at her, finally addressing her directly.

HANA
A custody officer.

Mara glares, whispering faster, like speed can compensate for volume.

MARA (whisper)
This is coercion. This is—this is illegal.

Hana nods like she’s heard this before.

HANA
Yes.
In the timelines where laws have jurisdiction over the real.

Len, whispering, voice shaky:

LEN (whisper)
Tyler, we can cut. We can leave.

Tyler looks back at them.

And for the first time, there’s a realization in his face that lands like a heavy object:

He doesn’t believe he can leave.

Not because the doors are locked.

Because the city will just… rearrange the sidewalk again.

Hana watches him clock it.

HANA
Good. You’re learning the difference between blocked and owned.

She turns, walks around the desk, and heads toward the hallway marked PRINCIPAL—NOT HERE.

She stops at the threshold and looks back.

HANA
You can film.
But understand this: the building is also filming you.

She points to the ceiling.

A smoke detector.

A sprinkler head.

A security camera that shouldn’t have power.

Its red light blinks once.

Slow.

Like a heartbeat.

HANA
Custody loves metadata.

Then she walks down the hallway.

Tyler hesitates.

The crew hesitates harder.

And then they do what they always do when the storm opens its mouth:

They follow.

## ACT V — “THE HALLWAY THAT GETS LONGER”

The hallway is too long for the building’s exterior.

They all notice it.

Nobody says it.

The fluorescent lights don’t flicker.

They pulse.

Each pulse a little like a countdown.

On the walls: children’s artwork.

Crayon drawings of Detroit streets.

Crayon drawings of a man with a magnet in his chest pulling buildings toward him like toy blocks.

Crayon drawings of a documentary camera with an eye inside the lens.

Jules’ whisper is barely a breath.

JULES
This… is about us too.

Tyler’s voice comes out raw.

TYLER
I didn’t ask for you.

Len whispers back, defensive, desperate.

LEN
We didn’t ask for this either.

Hana keeps walking, not looking back.

HANA
You did, actually.

Tyler frowns.

TYLER
No I didn’t.

Hana stops at a door.

The plaque reads:

GUIDANCE COUNSELOR

She puts her hand on the knob but doesn’t turn it yet.

HANA
You asked the world to make sense.
You asked for proof.
You asked to know who’s in charge when things don’t add up.

She looks over her shoulder.

HANA
The world heard “please” and filed it as “petition.”

She opens the door.

Inside is not an office.

Inside is… a gymnasium.

A full basketball court, bleachers, banners.

But the banners aren’t sports.

They’re categories.

EVIDENCE
BLAME
CUSTODY
APPEAL

At center court is a circle painted on the wood.

In the circle sits a single object:

A flip phone.

Old. Scuffed.

Waiting.

Tyler steps forward like it’s a bomb.

Mara whispers, more controlled now, the director brain rebooting under threat.

MARA
Stay wide. Get coverage. If we lose audio, keep visual. If we lose visual—

Her whisper catches.

Because the idea that they could lose visual feels suddenly… plausible.

Tyler stares at the phone.

Hana stands at the doorway like a bouncer for reality.

HANA
Pick it up.

Tyler looks back at her.

TYLER
Why?

Hana’s face is unreadable.

But her voice is almost… kind.

HANA
Because in this cursed timeline, you don’t get exits.
You get calls.

The phone rings.

A single, sharp ring that feels like it hits the inside of Tyler’s teeth.

He reaches down.

His fingers hover.

And on Cam D, on his body-cam, the image overlays something that isn’t in the room:

A faint AR-style UI, like invisible text floating in the air—

as if the world is about to show the audience something it doesn’t want Tyler to see.

[INCOMING: SUIT]

Tyler’s hand closes around the phone.

He lifts it.

The ring stops.

Hana exhales like she’s been holding her breath for a week.

HANA
Good.

Tyler flips it open.

TYLER
Hello?

And the documentary crew—every one of them—feels the moment the timeline tightens its grip.

Because the voice that answers isn’t in the phone.

It’s in the building.

It’s in the lights.

It’s in the camera lens.

SUIT (V.O.)
Tyler.
Don’t trust the school.

Tyler swallows.

TYLER
Who are you?

A pause.

Then, like someone smiling behind glass:

SUIT (V.O.)
I’m the part of you that remembers the ignition order.

Hana’s eyes sharpen.

Her calm breaks for half a second.

Just enough to show:

She knows exactly what that means.

And she doesn’t like it.
